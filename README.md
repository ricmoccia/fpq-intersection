# FPQ-Tree Intersection

This project implements and visualizes the intersection of FPQ-trees (PQ-trees with fixed F-nodes).

It is part of a broader research  on:
- One-stack DAG layouts
- Constrained vertex orderings
- Upward / book embedding problems

##  What is an FPQ-tree?

An FPQ-tree is a variant of a PQ-tree where:
- **F-nodes** (fixed nodes) enforce a fixed ordering of their children


FPQ-trees are used to represent constrained permutations of elements

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

This tool aims to:

- Represent FPQ-trees in textual form
- Compute intersections between FPQ-trees
- Visualize structure and constraints
- Serve as a foundation for further algorithmic research
